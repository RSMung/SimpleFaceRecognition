# 1 Implementing face recognition algorithms on CIFAR-100 dataset
I find out that popular face datasets in papers have many identities and massive images.

Furthermore, some pre-processing procedures are required before we utilize them to train our models or implement our algorithms.

I just want to have a simple impression about their performance. Then I decided to implement them on CIFAR-100 dataset.

> The performance of ArcFace on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 dataset is worse than softmax loss.
