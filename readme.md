### 1 Introduction

Implementing face recognition algorithms on CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 dataset

- Motivation

  - I find out that popular face datasets in papers have many identities and massive images.
    Furthermore, some pre-processing procedures are required before we utilize them to train our models or implement our algorithms.
- My Targets

  - I want to have a simple impression about their performance. Then I decided to implement them on CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10 dataset.

* Softmax Loss  (Deep face recognition, BMVC2015)

setup as a N-ways classification problem

* Triplet Loss   (FaceNet CVPR2015)

Facenet: A unified embedding for face recognition and clustering

* ArcFace (CVPR 2019)

Arcface: Additive angular margin loss for deep face recognition

Note: Adding margin to the angle of cosin similarity between features and the weights of the last fully connected layer.

* ElasticFace (CVPRW 2022)

Elasticface: Elastic margin loss for deep face recognition

Note: Changing the fixed margin value in ArcFace as sampling from gaussian distribution. The larger angles are associated with smaller margin values, and vice versa.

* UniFace (ICCV 2023)

Uniface: Unified cross-entropy loss for deep face recognition
